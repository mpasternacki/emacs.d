# My Emacs configuration

This repository uses
[Vendorificator](https://github.com/3ofcoins/vendorificator/) to
keep all Emacs libraries I use inside the repository. This way, I'm
not relying on authors to keep their programs indefinitely under the
same address, but still can easily review and update the libraries.
